# notes
- TypeScript extends set of primitive types with:
  - any (allow anything)
  - unknown (ensure someone using type declares what the type is)
  - never (it's not possible that this type could happen)
  - void (a function which returns undefined or has no return value)
- There are two syntaxes for building types:
  - interface (preffered)
  - type (when specific features are needed)
- With TypeScript, you can create complex types by combining simple ones:
  - with a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types
  - generics provide variables to types
- In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type. There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes.
- Process of contextual typing - the context that the function occured within informs what type it should have.
- Type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.
- Use interface until you need to use features from type.
- JavaScript has two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: null and undefined. TypeScript has two corresponding types by the same names. How these types behave depends on whether you have the strictNullChecks option on.
- Enums are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for describing a value which could be one of a set of possible named constants.
- From ES2020 onwards, there is a primitive in JavaScript used for very large integers, BigInt.
- There is a primitive in JavaScript used to create a globally unique reference via the function Symbol().
